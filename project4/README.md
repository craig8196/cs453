Multinomial Naive Bayes
=======================


Getting started
---------------
The 20NG.rar dataset must be unarchived in a directory called "documents".
Next, to adjust what dataset, how many cross validations to perform, etc., 
are located at the bottom of the file "naive_bayes.py".

Reading the output
------------------
The output of the program is as follows:
    number_of_features, feature_selection_time (in seconds), training_time (in seconds), testing_time (in seconds), accuracy (as a percentage)
